# first-non-repeating-character-strings

ALGO EXPERT EASY

Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters 
and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character. 

The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that
occurs only once. 

If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function 
should return -1.

Sample input: string = "abcdcaf" <br>
Sample output: 1 (The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1).
